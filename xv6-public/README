This is the README file for building and executing the hasPages() system call

To build the source files, run "make qemu" or "make qemu-nox". This should take you to the xv6 shell.

You can run the system call either by calling hasPages(int pid) in a user program or using "haspages pid" in the command line. hasPages takes a PID as input, and either returns information about the user pages of the process with this PID, or an error if the PID is invalid.

The test program "testHasPages" can be run in the shell with command "testHasPages". This test displays information about the calling process before and after allocating different kinds of memory to the process.
