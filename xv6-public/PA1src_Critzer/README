This is the README file for Jack Critzer's xv6 shell and functions



First ensure that xv6 has been built, and qemu has been installed on the system.

To build the source code, add shelly.c, whatIf.c, and Makefile to the folder containing the code for the xv6 shell. Run 'make qemu-nox' to compile and enter the shell.

To run the custom shell code, run 'shelly'.

Once in the custom shell, you will be able to run commands in the background using command 'nonohup prog args', which runs program prog with arguments args.

To exit the custom shell, press "ctl+d".

To run function whatIf, use command 'whatIf [args]' (arguments are optional).
